# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```


Gaps include unresolved test failures, centralized resolution (owner-only), and incomplete slashing (no burns/transfers), which could undermine the $500B counterfeit combat goal if not addressed. With fixes, this could score high in hackathon criteria (e.g., 4.2/5 as estimated in overview). Prioritize resolving errors for a polished MVP.
